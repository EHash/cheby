            - 1: Forces a low pulse of <code>EMU_LEN</code> clock cycles at each write to <code>EOIR</code>. Useful for edge-only IRQ controllers such as Gennum.

        Writing 1 to one of bits of this register causes a software emulation of the respective interrupt.

        Any write operation acknowledges the pending interrupt. Then, VIC advances to another pending interrupt(s) or releases the master interrupt output.

        Vector Address Table. Word at offset N stores the vector address of IRQ N. When interrupt is requested, VIC reads it's vector address from this memory and stores it in VAR register. The contents of this table can be pre-initialized during synthesis through <code>g_init_vectors</code> generic parameter. This is used to auto-enumerate interrupts in SDB-based designs.
